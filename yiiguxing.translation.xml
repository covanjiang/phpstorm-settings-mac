      <item value="Next, we will format the path of the file and store the file using a stream since they provide better performance than alternatives. Once we write the file this stream will get closed automatically by us so the developer doesn't have to." />

      <item value="Here is where you can register API routes for your application. These | routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which | is assigned the &quot;api&quot; middleware group. Enjoy building your API!" />

      <item value="This option controls the default Identity. You may change these defaults | as required, but they're a perfect start for most applications." />
      <item value="Data can be retrieved from the model object using the get() method of the model (e.g., `\result-&gt;get(\key)`) or &quot;accessing the result like an associative array (e.g. `\result['key']`).

      <item value="Returns the URL to an object identified by its bucket and key. The URL returned by this method is not signed nor does it ensure that the bucket and key given to the method exist. If you need a signed URL, then use the {@see \Aws\S3\S3Client::createPresignedRequest} method and get the URI of the signed request. @param string bucket The name of the bucket where the object is located @param string key The key of the object @return string The URL to the object" />
      <item value="This condition execution costs less than the previous one." />
      <item value="Once we save the related model, we need to attach it to the base model via through intermediate table so we'll use the existing &quot;attach&quot; method to accomplish this which will insert the record and any more attributes." />

      <item value="We'll load the axios HTTP library which allows us to easily issue requests to our Laravel back-end. This library automatically handles sending the CSRF token as a header based on the value of the &quot;XSRF&quot; token cookie." />

      <item value="We call this approach &quot;line based&quot;. We believe that Parsedown is the first Markdown parser to use it. Since the release of Parsedown, other developers have used the same approach to develop other Markdown parsers in PHP and in other languages." />
      <item value="It tries to read Markdown like a human. First, it looks at the lines. Itâ€™s interested in how the lines start. This helps it recognise blocks. It knows, for example, that if a line starts with a `-` then perhaps it belongs to a list. Once it recognises the blocks, it continues to the content. As it reads, it watches out for special characters. This helps it recognise inline elements (or inlines)." />

      <item value="If we actually found models we will also eager load any relationships that have been specified as needing to be eager loaded, which will solve the n+1 query issue for the developers to avoid running a lot of queries." />
      <item value="First we will check for the presence of a mutator for the set operation which simply lets the developers tweak the attribute as it is set on the model, such as &quot;json_encoding&quot; an listing of data for storage." />

      <item value="First we need to attach any of the associated models that are not currently // in this joining table. We'll spin through the given IDs, checking to see // if they exist in the array of current ones, and if not we will insert." />
